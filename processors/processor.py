# A Work Queue used to distribute all the different data among multiple workers (processors)
# Advantages: Easily parallelize work and scale

# By default, RabbitMQ will send each message to the next consumer, in sequence.
# On average every consumer will get the same number of messages.
# This way of distributing messages is called round-robin.
